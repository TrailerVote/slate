# Introduction

The TrailerVote SDK for iOS is a proprietary software library that enables movie-ticketing apps to increases user engagement and customer understanding by encouraging moviegoers to rate trailers as they are played on the big screen of the cinema, and/or rate trailers when watched on the phone. Users are later sent push notification reminders to buy tickets via the app when the movie opens in theatres.

Features include:

- Theatre-Optimized Audio Recognition: Optimized for complex cinema environments including 7+ speakers, reverb, echo, deep bass
- Branding & Styling: Custom branding for listening experience with your choice of background colors and logo.
- Offline audio recognition: Minimizes the need for network connectivity at the cinema by caching content
- Custom Recognition: Identify trailer content, loyalty program promotions, or advertisements and serve the corresponding interactions.

# Requirements

In order to use TrailerVote technology, you must have the following:

- A mobile app
- Xcode 9 or higher
- iOS 10 or higher

# iOS
## Getting Started

1. Download & unzip the latest iOS SDK from https://trailervote.com/downloads/ios-sdk.
2. Drag TrailerVoteSDK.framework into your Xcode project tree:
  ![alt text](/images/img_framework_in_project_tree.png "TrailerVote Framework in Xcode Project")
3. In your app Target Settings -> General tab, under the Embedded Binaries section, click the + button and select the imported TrailerVoteSDK.framework item. Click the Add button.

## In-Theatre Audio Recognition


> Simply call the class method to access the singleton instance.

```objective_c
[TVTrailerVoteFactory sharedFactory]
```

```swift
TVTrailerVoteFactory.shared()
```

TrailerVote SDK provides the main factory class TVTrailerVoteFactory, containing various methods for adding the different components of the TrailerVote experience to your app.


## Configuring and initializing the TrailerVote SDK

```objective_c
[TVTrailerVoteFactory setupCredentialsWithUsername:password:]
```

```swift
TVTrailerVoteFactory.setupCredentials(withUsername:password:)
```

In order to use the SDK, you are required to provide the set of credentials (username/password). This can be done by calling the method. Please note that the invocation of this method should precede any other calls on the SDK factory class, otherwise an exception will be thrown indicating the absence of credentials.

The initialization process of the SDK begins immediately upon the first invocation of [TVTrailerVoteFactory sharedFactory] method. All internal dependencies and SDK resources are initialized automatically.

In order for the TrailerVote In-Theatre feature to work offline, the movie trailers recognition data needs to be downloaded from the network.

```objective_c
[[TVTrailerVoteFactory sharedFactory] launchDataPreload]
```

```swift
TVTrailerVoteFactory.shared().launchDataPreload()
```

To start the pre-loading process of the trailer recognition data, call the launchDataPreload method. Once the data is downloaded, the trailer recognition feature will be available in offline.



##Enabling and configuring the TrailerVote In-Theatre feature
The main feature of the SDK is the movie trailers recognition. We use the TVAudioRecognitionViewController class for presenting a full-screen user interface and for handling the recognition processes.
![alt text](/images/img_recognition_screen.png "TrailerVote Listening Screen")

```objective_c
TVAudioRecognitionViewController * audioRecognitionVC = [[TVTrailerVoteFactory sharedFactory] audioRecognitionViewController];
```

```swift
let audioRecognitionVC = TVTrailerVoteFactory.shared().audioRecognitionViewController()
```

Instantiate the view controller by calling the [TVTrailerVoteFactory audioRecognitionViewController] method of the main factory class:


##Presenting the Voting Experience

```objective_c
[self presentViewController:audioRecognitionVC animated:YES completion:nil];
```

```swift
present(audioRecognitionVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

After creating an instance, the audio recognition view controller can be easily presented using UIKit present(_:animated:completion:) method:


When the movie trailer is recognized, the voting buttons are shown with the prompt for the user to vote.
![alt text](/images/img_recognition_screen_voting.png "TrailerVote Listening Screen")
After the user votes, the feedback is recorded internally in the SDK and transmitted to TrailerVote. This means that this information is visible in the voted trailers feed and any API that exposes the vote.

Note: Special advertisement clips, such as ad banners or special action triggers are handled differently - the fullscreen web view is presented with the corresponding url being loaded or some other UI elements are presented, such as the “Put your phones away” view.

##Branding

```objective_c
[[TVTrailerVoteFactory sharedFactory] setPartnerLogoImage:]
```

```swift
TVTrailerVoteFactory.shared().setPartnerLogoImage(_:)
```

The SDK provides the ability to set the logo image displayed on the initial movie card. Call the method providing your own logo image to use.


```objective_c
[[TVTrailerVoteFactory sharedFactory] setDefaultVotingCardBackgroundImage:]
```

```swift
TVTrailerVoteFactory.shared().setDefaultVotingCardBackgroundImage(_:)
```

You can override the default voting card background as well by calling the method providing your own background image to use.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```
